# Automatic Enemy Behavior Generation for Survival Games

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of an algorithm for **automatic generation of enemy behavior** in survival-type video games.

## About the Project

Survival games are a genre where the main objective of the player is to survive as long as possible in a dynamic and hostile environment. Players gather resources, build shelters, and manage various survival needs. A key part of the challenge comes from enemies, who intermittently threaten the player and must be defeated for resource rewards.

### Problem

Manually designing diverse and engaging enemy behaviors is time-consuming and often lacks scalability. In order to enrich gameplay and assist game designers, there is a need for a tool that can automatically generate varied, editable, and explainable enemy behavior patterns.

### Goal

The main goal of this project is to **design and implement an algorithm for automatic generation of enemy behavior** in survival games. The algorithm is intended to be used as a support tool during the game design phase. It should:

* Generate **diverse and non-repetitive** behaviors.
* Provide behaviors in a form that is **explainable** and **manually editable** by game designers.
* Allow for **experimental evaluation** of the behavior quality and algorithm characteristics.

## Features

* Rule-based and/or data-driven enemy behavior generation.
* Configurable generation parameters for different types of enemies and scenarios.
* Modular design suitable for integration into a broader game design pipeline.
* Tools for analyzing and visualizing generated behavior patterns.
* Evaluation scripts for testing behavior diversity and quality.


## Evaluation

The thesis includes an experimental evaluation to:

* Assess the diversity and quality of generated behaviors.
* Compare generated enemies with manually designed ones.
* Analyze the algorithm's performance and design flexibility.
